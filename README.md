##Script Details

**Perl Code**
1. getCommon.pl : Compares two files : each with a list of elements and finds cshared elements.  Can also take two files with multiple columns.  Then you have to provide the column number to compare for each file as well as the delimiter.  Run the code as `perl getCommon.pl` to get help on the syntax.
